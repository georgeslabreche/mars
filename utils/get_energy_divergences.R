# Solar panel area has been cited as 1.3 m2 but we need the actual solar cell coverage area.
#
# There is a total of 499 cells:
#   165 on the left wing.
#   167 on the right wing.
#   102 on the rear wing.
#   65 on the body.
#
# The cell size is 3.95 cm x 6.89 cm with two cropped corners. This provides an active area of 26.6 cm2.
# The CIC size is 3.97 cm x 6.91 cm.The slight difference is the small amount of coverglass overhang.
#   Source: E-mail exchange with Richard C. Ewell (NASA/JPL).
#
# The solar cell coverage area is thus 499 * 26.6 cm2 = 13273.4 cm2 = 1.32734 m2
# It turns out that the cited solar panel area is in actuality the solar cell coverage area.

# Performance ratio / coefficient for losses is determined based on literature:
#
#   1. Thomas W. Kerslake et al.:
#       On a given day, cell efficiency varies 3% due to changing temperature and
#       red - shift spectral losses through the day time-period.
#
#   2. Geoffrey A. Landis et al.: 
#       2.1 Dust deposition on the solar arrays was measured on the Pathfinder
#           mission to to degrade the performance at a rate of 0.28% per sol
#           during the initial 30 sols of the mission.
#       2.2 Longer measures on MER missions indicate that long-term degradation
#            is about 0.14% per sol.
#
#   3. Jeremiah McNatt et al.:
#       After deployment, a 5% permanent dust power loss is added to the assumption
#       with more accumulated dust removed periodically.
#
#   4. Paul M. Stella et al.
#       Dust performance degradation is about 30%.
#
# By default, use [1] and [3].
# Also use dust factor measurements taken by Opportunity instead of [2] and [4].
# Assume 5% loss due to shadowing onthe panels (e.g. from the mastcam).
# 
#   Loss_temp_redshit:      Cell efficiency varies due to changing temperature and red shift.
#   Loss_permanent_dust:    After deployment, a permanent dust power loss is added to the assumption
#                           with more accumulated dust removed periodically.
#   Loss_shadowing:         Loss due to shadows on the solar call cast devices such as the rover mast and mastcam.
#   SolarArray_DustFactor:  Perfectly clean solar arrays would have a dust factor of 1.0, so the larger the dust factor,
#                           the cleaner the arrays.
#   DustFactor_adjustment:  The Dust factor adjustment is a percentage value that can be used
#                           to bound the difference between min and max diverences.
#                           e.g. A dust factor adjustment of 8% will bound the divergence between
#                           predicted energy and measured energy to an error margin from -20% to +20%.
