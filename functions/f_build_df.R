# Build a dataframe representation of Table III referenced in Appelbaum, Joseph & Flood, Dennis. (1990).
#
# From Appelbaum, Joseph & Flood, Dennis. (1990):
#   The net solar flux integrated over the solar spectrum on the Martian
#   surface was calculated by Pollack basd on multiple wavelength and
#   multiple scattering of the solar radiation. Derived data from this
#   calculation are shown Table III by the normalized net flux function
#   f(Z, tau) where the parameters are the zenith angle Z and the optical
#   depth tau. This table pertains to an albedo of 0.1 but can be used
#   for higher albedo values to a first approximation.
#
# Based on the following publication:
# Appelbaum, Joseph & Flood, Dennis. (1990). Solar radiation on Mars. Solar Energy. 45. 353â€“363. 10.1016/0038-092X(90)90156-7.

# al        - The albedo. Options are:
#               - 0.1 for pub_year 1990.
#               - 0.1 or 0.2 for pub_year 1991.
# pub_year  - The research paper's publication year. Retrieve data from the given publication year.
#             There were 2 updates after the origina publication in 1989/1990. Once in 1990 and another one in 1991.
